Attached are five sample JavaScript files (train1.js, badusb_demo.js, event_loop.js, gui.js, interactive.js) that work on the Flipper Zero. Flipper Zero JavaScript is based on the mJS engine, which is fairly restricted version of JavaScript.  You should only use functions defined in the training file, no additional built-in commands are supported.  You should not redefine any function that is used in the training file. Please see the comments in train1.js file for more details.
